🚀 Learn Microservices with RabbitMQ and User Authentication in NestJS

I’ve been working on a simple project to help developers get started with microservices using NestJS and RabbitMQ. Along the way, I also implemented user registration and login functionality with SQLite for data persistence.

🌟 What’s Included in the Project?
1️⃣ Microservices with RabbitMQ: Learn how to build microservices and integrate them with RabbitMQ for seamless message-based communication.
 2️⃣ User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionalities using SQLite to store and manage user data.
 3️⃣ Hands-On Learning: A step-by-step guide for setting up and exploring the codebase.

🔧 Need Help Installing RabbitMQ?
I’ve also created a detailed YouTube video to show you how to install and configure RabbitMQ on Windows. Whether you're just starting or need a refresher, this guide will walk you through the process.

Remember that the queue names must not be the same in the microservice definition and usage.

🔑 What You’ll Learn:
How to set up RabbitMQ and connect it with NestJS microservices.
Basics of building a message-based microservices architecture.
Implementing user registration and login functionality with SQLite.
This project is perfect for beginners who want to dive into microservices or developers looking to expand their knowledge of NestJS and RabbitMQ.

💡 Pro Tip: Even if you’re new to RabbitMQ or microservices, this project will give you a solid foundation to start building scalable and efficient systems.
